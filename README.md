### Images

I started out creating Battle for Wesnoth unit "Pixel Art" by "frankensteining" existing mainline and UMC sprites.

"Frankensteining" refers to the process of taking complete unit sprites, cutting out specific areas, and combining multiple of these snippets into a new unit sprite.

With more experience and plenty of "frankensteined" unit sprites created, I started adding more and more custom and individual aspects to my sprites, eventually creating completely new units, such as the "Grave Sentinel", an alternative advancement line of the undead Skeleton Archer.

The following unit sprites were created by myself. Whilst few provide only base sprites, most provide simple or even more enhanced attack animation frames.

- Elvish Stormfeather (slightly animated)
- Orcish Lifebinder (base frame)
- Orcish Scout (base frame)
- Orcish Brawler (fully animated, with plenty of variations as well)
- Orcish Brutestalker (fully animated)
- Orcish Bloodscourge (slightly animated)
- Orcish Doombringer (slightly animated)
- Banescourge (fully animated)
- Death Marshal (base frame)
- Scourgeeater (slightly animated)
- Grave Sentinel (fully animated)
- Skullbarrager (base frame)
- Skullslinger (slightly animated)
- Grave Titan (fully animated)

Whilst I do not maintain an accurate list, most sprites of units **not** listed above were copied from the following 
add-ons:

- A Whim of Fate
- Ageless Era
- Archaic Era
- A Sanguine Tale
- Era of Magic
- Invincible Conquest II
- Legend of the Invincibles
- Rashy Era
- Reign of the Lors
- The Dark Rising

### Configurations

Whilst I try to provide as many unique custom unit configurations as possible, including weapon specials and abilities, not all of this repository's content sources from my own creation.

Some configurations may be based on an idea from the same add-on list provided above.
